About
-------------

Typography, and its many types, is instrumental in communicating things of all types. In the visual world that makes up much of our information age, types of letters, types of words, types of language, types of meanings, types of stories, and so on, all gain significance by way of typography.

Types, a site-specific exhibition designed by Display, a revolving design collective and artistic rubric led by Katherine Walker with Ken Frederick, presents an exploration of typography as it embodies multiple methods of literary and visual communication, including print design, signage, environmental graphics, and more. Using writer Claire Keys’ fictional vignettes featuring untranslat- able foreign words as inspirational content, Display has transformed the gallery space into a physically all-encompassing installation to demonstrate typography’s incredible ability to simultaneously encompass the linguistic, literary and visual arts.

Types by Display is curated by Jamilee Polson Lacy.
